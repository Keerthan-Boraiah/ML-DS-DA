I coudnt implement changes on my code from last time because of the instructions of academic officer. But i have included citation for the code and its uses, why i used it and where i used it from, and rephased the rules copied from university website in the report.

1:- THE GENETIC ALGORITHM IS IMPLEMENTED IN run_game_simple.py
2:- 6 Rules are implemented in simple_agent.py

3:- In GENETIC ALGORITHM the steps involved are:-
	Popolation calculation (Random good chromosomes and random bad chromosomes in array)
	Fitness calculation (calcualted by the score of the game from above population chromosomes
	parent/mating (taken the best chromosomes score)
	Child selection (worst chromosomes score)
	Mating/crossover (crossover of child/parent to get offspring)
	offspring (this is used again as new chromosomes and get score and go genetic algorithm again until satisifying score


RUN run_game_simple.py to get the best chromosomes and the best score and use that in hanabi practice test to check out of 25 score

THANK YOU.
