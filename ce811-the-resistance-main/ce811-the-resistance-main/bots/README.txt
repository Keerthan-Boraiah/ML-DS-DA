beginners.py
    Bots implemented by Alex J. Champandard as examples for the jam and further
    refined for the Vienna Game/AI Conference 2012.

intermediate.py
    Bounder was designed by Peter Cowling, though like Simpleton this was 
    implemented by Alex J. Champandard as an example of the maximal (?) amount
    of logical reasoning possible on the sabotage results.

cheaters.py
    Based on a prototype and concept by Tom Shaul, these bots are implemented
    by Alex J. Champandard as a way to measure properties of the game and bots
    under different conditions (e.g. knowing other bots are 70% correct).
