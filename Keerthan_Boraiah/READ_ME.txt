How to Run my models and code
Data is Collected by Loggerbot.py by running it for 10000 games by beginners.py (Explained in Report)
1. Data Prep and Neural Network Model is coded in jupyter notebook and saved in .ipynb format
2. The Built Model is Saved in .h5 format as Neural_Network.h5
3. Run keerthanbot.py by importing Neural_Network.h5 and playing against beginners.py, intermediates.py, experts.py
4. code to run (python competition.py 100 bots/beginners.py bots/keerthanbot.py)
